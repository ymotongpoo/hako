# hako
busybox porting in Go. My personal bonsai project. "hako" means "box" in Japanese.
The goal of this project is to provide commands that are provided by busybox
across variety of platforms. So the size of binary may not be optimized well,
though origial project's objective is there.

# Acknowledgement
